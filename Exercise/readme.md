### Exercise list

- [x] 1-13. Write a program to print a histogram of the length of words in it's input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

- [x] 1-14. Write  a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in it's input.

- [ ] 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print  the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.

- [x] 1-17. Write a program to print all input lines that are longer then 80 characters.

- [ ] 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.

- [ ] 1-19. Write a function `reverse(s)` that reverses the character string s. Use it to write a program that reverses it's input a line at the time.

- [ ] 1-20. Write a program `detab` that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every `n` columns. Should `n` be a variable or a symbolic parameter?

- [ ] 1-21. Write a program `entab` that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for `detab`. When either a tab or single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference?

- [ ] 1-22. Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks of tabs before the specified column.

- [ ] 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments fro a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments do not nest.

- [ ] 1-24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality.)
