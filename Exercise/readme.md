### Exercise list
- [x] 1-13. Write a program to print a histogram of the length of words in it's input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

- [x] 1-14. Write  a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in it's input.

- [ ] 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print  the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.

- [x] 1-17. Write a program to print all input lines that are longer then 80 characters.

- [ ] 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.

- [ ] 1-19. Write a function `reverse(s)` that reverses the character string s. Use it to write a program that reverses it's input a line at the time.
